Things to do
============

Short Term Misc
---------------
Support for `_FREE` and `_STACK` (these are read, but ignored at present).

Support inline assembly in C/C++ output.

More documentation.

Code cleanup

Better error messages.

Add in the missing openspin options to fastspin.

Support @@@foo + offset in --asm mode.

Optimization
------------

Take advantage of commutative operators to improve optimization.

Put more commonly used functions in COG RAM, and/or FCACHE whole functions
if they are called a lot.

Allow system functions to go into HUB RAM to free up COG space.

Better fcache loading code.


Long Term
---------

Finish P2 support.

Implement a spin bytecode back end.

Implement a Tachyon bytecode back end.

Implement a Basic front-end.
